    <h2>What is Gestalt psychology?</h2>
    <p>Gestalt psychology, school of psychology founded in the 20th century that provided the
    foundation for the modern study of perception. Gestalt theory emphasizes that the 
    whole of anything is greater than its parts. That is, the attributes of the whole
    are not deducible from analysis of the parts in isolation. The word Gestalt is
    used in modern German to mean the way a thing has been “placed,” or “put together.” 
    There is no exact equivalent in English. “Form” and “shape” are the usual 
    translations; in psychology the word is often interpreted as “pattern” or “configuration.”
    </p>
    <p>
    Gestalt theory originated in Austria and Germany as a reaction against the 
    associationist and structural schools’ atomistic orientation (an approach 
    which fragmented experience into distinct and unrelated elements). Gestalt
    studies made use instead of phenomenology. This method, with a tradition
    going back to Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, involves nothing more than the description of
    direct psychological experience, with no restrictions on what is permissible in the description. 
    Gestalt psychology was in part an attempt to add a humanistic dimension to what was considered a sterile approach to the scientific study of mental life.
    Gestalt psychology further sought to encompass the qualities of form, meaning, and value that prevailing psychologists
    had either ignored or presumed to fall outside the boundaries of science
    (taken from: <a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/Gestalt-psychology" target="_blank">Encyclopaedia Britannica</a>).
    </p>
    <p>The main subject of Gestalt Psychology is investigating  Gestalt - pattern of visual
       perception characterized by structure different from its parts. In the course of the
       20th century philosophy, this, so called “holistic” approach was mostly rejected by the
       academic society, especially in empirical sciences. Consequently, Gestalt psychology was
       considered marginal and dead-ended branch of psychology. As a result it undergone a kind
       of oblivion. All three main founders of the Berlin School of Gestalt psychology
        (Max Wertheimer, Kurt Koffka, Wolfgang Kohler) emigrated to the United States and 
        continued their research in American  universities, yet there was no sufficient  
        development in this area until the recent time.</p>
            <a href="#top">back to TOC</a><br>
        <h2 id="50">The Founders:Max Wertheimer,Kurt Koffka, Wolfgang Kohler</h2>
<p>Founded by Max Wertheimer before the First World War and then further advanced
in collaboration with Wolfgang Kohler, Kurt Koffka, and others through the Weimar years, Gestalt theory argued for the possibility of retaining a place for human significance in nature but without sacrificing rigorous experimental standards of traditional natural science. It was not an approach everyone would find congenial. At the time Wertheimer and his colleagues began developing their ideas, the idea of Gestalt (which can be literally translated as "form" or "configuration") had already been identified in the broader holistic literature with a range of more quasi-mystical cultural values and goals, few of which had much to do with either rigor or with science. 
In this literature, Gestalt worked as an ordering principle in partnership with wholeness
had dominated German psychological research. (Harrington, Anne. 1999. <em>Reenchanted Science: Holism in German culture from Wilhelm II to Hitler.</em> Princeton: Princeton University Press.‏
).</p>
        <h2>Max Wertheimer (1880-1943) </h2>
<p>Born in Prague on April 15, 1880, Wertheimer was the younger son of a religiously conservative,
intellectual Jewish family. In Prague, he was introduced to German culture by monks at the Piarot Grammar School and to Jewish intellectual and mystical traditions by his grandfather
Jakob Zwicker.It was the grandfather who secretly introduced Wertheimer to Benedict Spinoza's
heretical holism, which his father had forbidden him to read.Wertheimer was profoundly
influenced by his early exposure to this philosopher. The metaphysician not only gave him a 
framework through which to question traditional Jewish injunctions, but also provided him with 
resources to conceive of the problem of order (Gestalt) and mind in a nondualistic way (Harrington, Anne. 1999. <em>Reenchanted Science: Holism in German culture from Wilhelm II to Hitler.</em> Princeton: Princeton University Press.‏
).</p>
<p> Max Wertheimer began the formal founding of Gestalt psychology in 1910 as he began experiments on the phi phenomenon.The phi phenomenon is apparent movement caused by alternating light positions. Wertheimer illustrated this phenomenon on an apparatus he built that utilized two discrete lights on different locations. Although the lights are stationary, flashing the lights at succeeding time intervals causes the retina to perceive the light as moving. Wertheimer worked with partners Koffka and Köhler to collect data which ultimately led to their launch of the Gestalt movement.
Their findings further demonstrated that the quality of the whole is different from the sum of the parts.</p>
<p>Wertheimer represented his country in World War I as a captain in the army. After coming back from the war he gave lectures and pursued his research on perception and gestalt in the University of Berlin until 1933.
But in 1933, dramatic changes in Germany's regime encouraged or convinced Wertheimer to leave Germany;
The Wertheimer family moved to the United States.that's why Max Wertheimer is referred to as a
German-American psychologist (taken from: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Wertheimer" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>).</p>   
                <h2>Kurt Koffka</h2>
<p>Kurt Koffka (1886 – 1941) was a German psychologist who, together with Max Wertheimer
and Wolfgang Köhler, established Gestalt psychology. His work on perception showed that 
we perceive in terms of whole objects, which are greater than the sum of their parts. 
This challenged Wilhelm Wundt's mechanistic approach to experimental psychology, which 
had dominated German psychological research. </p>
<p>Koffka believed psychologists need to always look at the things holistically, in the 
context of where those things are located. The purpose of science in general, 
is not to simply collect facts, but to incorporate facts into a theoretical whole. 
Theoretical systems must incorporate all the facts and create a rational system.
Since all the facts are interdependent, a successful theoretical system will not deny 
 or neglect even the smallest fact. Koffka criticized scientists who created theoretical 
systems based on facts that fit into their system, while denying facts that did not fit(taken from:
<a href="http://www.newworldencyclopedia.org/entry/Kurt_Koffka" target="_blank">New world Encyclopaedia</a>).</p>
<p>In 1922 there appeared in the Psychological Bulletin Koffka's first paper written in
English: <em><q><a href= "Koffka.1922.PDF" target="_blank">Perception: an Introduction to the
Gestalt Theory."</a></em></q> Systematic and thought-provoking, 
with many of the characteristics which were to be found in the longer discussions in the
Principles of Gestalt Psychology, the experimental studies on which Gestalt theory was based 
were(Harrington, Anne. 1999. <em>Science: Holism in German culture from Wilhelm II to Hitler.</em> Princeton: Princeton University Press.‏) </p>                                   

<p> Following Max Wertheimer, Kurt Koffka defined: <q>'What happens to a part of the whole, is determined by intrinsic laws inherent
    in this whole'</q> (Koffka, Kurt.1935.(<em> Principles of Gestalt Psychology.</em> New York: Harcourt, Brace and
    Company).For example, if we cover some areas of the actual visual field, the new perception will be reorganized in accordance
    with the same rules. I can look at a facial expression, or I can actually perceive only part of a
    face, for example, eyes or nose. All these perceptions reveal wholeness of expressive
    meaning. Eyes and nose taken separately have their own expression. Based on his research with newborns, Koffka had concluded that an infant
    recognizes the familiar face and reacts differently to different expressions, before he knows anything about the world (Koffka, Kurt.1980. 
    <em> Growth of the Mind: An Introduction to Child Psychology. </em>.
    Koffka wrote that 'if sensationalist theories
    of the original chaos were sound, that "simple" stimuli would first arouse the child's
    attention'. However, the infant is interested in human faces and responds to the human
    voice, and not to the simple sensations of light or dark spots. He perceives expressions, and
    not a meaningless sensory element. In other words, the perception of 'friendliness' is simpler
    than the perception of a red spot.</p>

            <h2> Wolfgang Kohler</h2>
<p>Wolfgang Köhler (1887 – 1967) was a German psychologist and phenomenologist who, like 
Max Wertheimer, and Kurt Koffka, contributed to the creation of Gestalt psychology.</p> 
<p>In 1910–13, he was an assistant at the Psychological Institute in Frankfurt in which he 
worked with fellow psychologists Max Wertheimer and Kurt Koffka. He and Koffka functioned as 
subjects for Wertheimer's now-famous studies of apparent movement (or the phi phenomenon), 
which led them in turn to conclusions about the inherent nature of vision. They collaborated on
the founding of a new holistic attitude toward psychology called Gestalt theory. </p> 
<p>He wrote a book on problem solving titled <em>The Mentality of Apes</em> (1917). In this research, 
Köhler observed how chimpanzees solve problems, such as that of retrieving bananas when 
positioned out of reach. He found that they stacked wooden crates to use as makeshift ladders, 
in order to retrieve the food. If the bananas were placed on the ground outside of the cage, 
they used sticks to lengthen the reach of their arms. Köhler concluded that the chimps are
"unwaveringly purposeful."The conclusions drawn from the experiments with apes were that these 
animals exhibit insight and that they demonstrate intelligent behaviour that is common in humans. 
Köhler states that these findings hold true for every member of the species (taken from:
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolfgang_K%C3%B6hler" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>).</p>      
<p>Kohler, who was not Jewish, had been one of the few German professors with the courage officially to protest academic "coordination" under the new order in 1933. Although not dismissed for this, his institute was denounced for continuing to favor Jews at the expense of "Germans," while an increasingly Nazified student body accused junior researchers in the institute of communist activities. When it became
clear that his institute would not be left in peace, Kohler left Berlin in 1934 for a position at Swarthmore
College in the United States (Harrington, Anne. 1999. <em>Reenchanted Science: Holism in German culture from Wilhelm II to Hitler</em> Princeton: Princeton University Press.‏
).</p>
                      
    <h2 id="60"> Applications of Gestalt Psychology </h2>      
    <p>There was no sufficient  development in this area until the recent time.  
    According to my observations, the situation  is changing today. The  popularity of 
    Gestalt psychology in the academic word is growing. Why the interest in it reappeared now?
    I assume that several factors can explain  this. First,  there is what Mitchell has 
    called a “pictorial turn”: the changing of cultural paradigms from linguistic to more
    visual one.  I think, that the important reason for this turn is the significant improvement 
    in the means of visual media and communication. Especially,  the digitalization of culture
    which happened in the last 20 years. Our life today is surrounded by pictures.
     The employment of Gestalt principles for designing websites, interfaces and applications 
     made them important for graphic design. The other reason for this is the recent development
     of life sciences which caused the renewed interest in holistic patterns.</p>
